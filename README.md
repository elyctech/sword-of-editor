## Disclaimer

This project is not necessarily a passion project. It is intended to be a place for me to "mindlessly" hack away. As such, the code quality may not be the greatest, updates will likely be sporatic (if they happen at all), and no commitment is given to support of this project. That said, if you do find this project useful and have ideas that you would like to see implemented _eventually_, feel free to submit an enhancement issue. Who knows - I may mindlessly hack these ideas into the project at some point. Bug reports are also welcome, but with the same disclaimer that they _might_ get fixed _eventually_ depending on how I am feeling about working on this project. I make absolutely no guarantees about contributions to this project over time.
